Hi, I’m Kristian — Front-End Development student at Noroff, graduating summer 2026.

I’m passionate about building clean, fast, and accessible websites with great user experiences. Right now I’m deep into HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, responsive design, and modern workflows — and I love seeing my projects come to life.

Alongside my studies, I work as a Sales Associate at Harddisk, where I help customers daily with PCs, mobiles, components, and accessories. I troubleshoot and fix issues on the spot (phones, computers, custom builds, you name it), so I bring real-world IT expertise and strong customer-facing skills to everything I do.

I’m excited to combine fresh front-end knowledge with years of hands-on tech experience when I enter the industry full-time in summer 2026.

Always up for a chat about code, projects, or future opportunities — feel free to reach out!
